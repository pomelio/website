# What the platform is

- `Pagwe OS` is a network operating system. It provides network APIs to run `serverless` network computing.
- The `Wallaby programming language` is the programming language of `Pagwe OS`. Programs access network APIs through it to complete network computing tasks.
- `Pagwe OS` project files are hosted in the user's GitHub repositories.
- The `Pagwe admin website` can create projects, import users' GitHub repositories, and run and debug projects.
- `Pagwe projects` contain Wallaby executable code files, template files, and other files. Users can bind their `domain name` to handle all `HTTP requests` to this domain.
- The `Wallaby debugger` can intercept `HTTP requests` to `Wallaby executable files`, set `breakpoints`, step through code, inspect current `variables value``, and more for debugging programs.
