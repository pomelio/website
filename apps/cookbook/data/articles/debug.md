# Project debugging

The Admin Web Portal includes a powerful debugger that helps you quickly identify bugs and accelerate your development process. You can set breakpoints, inspect variable values, step through code, or run to the next breakpoint. When an error occurs, the debugger provides detailed information to assist you in identifying the issue. During program execution, the debugger also prints useful information to help you understand the program's runtime behavior. This debugger is a valuable tool for troubleshooting and optimizing your code while developing on the platform.
