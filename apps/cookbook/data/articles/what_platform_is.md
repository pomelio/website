# What the platform is

The Pagwe platform is a Serverless computing platform that consists of the following components:

- Pagwe OS (Pagwe Operating System): Pagwe OS is the core of the entire platform, providing a Serverless computing environment. This operating system decouples programs from specific runtime environments, allowing programs to run dynamically on different servers. This provides flexibility and convenience for developers.

- Wallaby Programming Language: Wallaby is the programming language of Pagwe OS used to write Serverless applications. It aims for a concise syntax, powerful expressiveness, and I/O optimization. Wallaby language enables developers to write Serverless applications in a clear and concise manner.

- Pagwe Cluster: Pagwe Cluster is a combination of servers running different services. These servers can be dynamically added or removed to accommodate the number of HTTP requests. It includes an Admin Service for project management and Worker Services for handling HTTP requests and running Wallaby programs.

- Pagwe Admin Website: The Pagwe Admin website serves as an interface for creating projects, importing GitHub repositories, and online debugging of projects. Developers can use this website to manage their projects and debug their project.


These components together make up the Pagwe platform, providing a flexible and efficient Serverless computing environment aimed at reducing the workload of developers and improving development efficiency.
